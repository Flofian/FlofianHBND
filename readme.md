Simple sona plugin, currently only in addition to another plugin\
It helps with Auto-Q usage, it can also use q to amplify an allies auto attack with extra checks to also include a direct hit\
Also has a check to only use Q when Summon Aery is ready (maybe bugged when you get aery from ally?)\
And it has a kind of anti-melee e usage, where u press e when enemy is near you or an ally in range

TODO:
- Maybe Split up W Shield into targeted and skillshot, since incoming dmg has no timing
- So maybe stuff gets shielded too early


- Check if Aery owner is me
