Simple sona plugin, currently only in addition to another plugin

To Use:  
Download FlofianSona.shard from Releases  
Put it in your Hanbot/League of Legends/Shards folder


Features:
- Auto Q direct (1 or 2 targets)
- Auto Q aura to amplify auto attacks (Self/Ally, also include direct Hit)
- Note: Currently only basic attacks, no abilities that apply on-hit effects
- Auto W for Shield (Self, Ally)
- ^ Option so it only uses w when it also Heals
- Anti-Melee E (Self and Ally)

TODO:
- Maybe Split up W Shield into targeted and skillshot, since incoming dmg has no timing
- So maybe stuff gets shielded too early
- Check if Aery owner is me
- Maybe try to amplify multiple auto attacks?
