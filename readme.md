Simple sona plugin, currently only in addition to another plugin
It helps with Auto-Q usage, it can also use q to amplify an allies auto attack with extra checks to also include a direct hit
Also has a check to only use Q when Summon Aery is ready (maybe bugged when you get aery from ally?)
And it has a kind of anti-melee e usage, where u press e when enemy is near you or an ally in range

TODO:
- Use W as shield
- ^ Only when also healing
- On targeted
- On Skillshot?
- ^ Custom delay? (You can cast really late since aura is instant)
